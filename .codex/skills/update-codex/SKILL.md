description: Use when updating this codex-app Linux port from the latest upstream Codex Mac DMG, preserving local Linux patches, installing the refreshed desktop app, and publishing the tag-driven Linux release artifacts.

# Update Codex

Use this skill only from `/home/amwill/Applications/codex-app`.

## Contract

- Fetch the latest official upstream Mac artifact from `https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg`.
- Verify latest version/build against `https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/appcast.xml`.
- Refresh `desktop/recovered/app-asar-extracted` from `Codex.dmg`.
- Preserve Linux behavior patches in `desktop/scripts/assemble-codex-runtime.mjs`, especially:
  - Linux hidden titlebar/titlebar overlay path.
  - Linux native menu hide/remove behavior.
  - Linux external browser routing for auth and plugin/app flows.
  - Linux open-in target registry and browser-session launcher.
  - Linux pet/avatar overlay stability patches, including the X11/XWayland
    desktop launch contract required for reliable dragging and always-on-top
    behavior under GNOME Wayland sessions.
- Install the rebuilt runtime to `~/.local/opt/codex-desktop/<version>-<build>` and repoint `~/.local/opt/codex-desktop/current`.
- If the user asks to ship/release, commit, push `main`, tag `v<version>`, and wait for `.github/workflows/linux-release.yml` to publish assets.

## Workflow

1. Download and verify:
   - `curl -L --fail --output Codex.dmg https://persistent.oaistatic.com/codex-app-prod/Codex.dmg`
   - Read `appcast.xml` and confirm the newest arm64 release version/build.
   - Extract or inspect `Codex.dmg` enough to confirm `Info.plist` version/build and `app.asar` hash.

2. Refresh recovered bundle:
   - Run `desktop/scripts/refresh-recovered-from-dmg.mjs --dmg ../Codex.dmg --output ./recovered/app-asar-extracted` from `desktop`.
   - Update `desktop/package.json`, `desktop/package-lock.json`, and tests that pin version/build metadata.
   - If minified bundle shapes drift, add new patch alternatives without removing older supported shapes.

3. Verify patch preservation:
   - `node --check desktop/scripts/assemble-codex-runtime.mjs`
   - `npm test -- --runInBand tests/linux/recovered-bundle.red.test.ts`
   - `npm run test:linux`
   - `npm run test:linux:codex-package`

4. Build and install:
   - Build with `desktop/scripts/build-codex-linux-runtime.mjs` into `desktop/out/Codex-linux-x64-codex-<version>-<build>`.
   - Copy that staged runtime to `~/.local/opt/codex-desktop/<version>-<build>`.
   - Update `~/.local/opt/codex-desktop/current`.
   - Validate desktop entries and refresh the desktop database.
   - Confirm `~/.local/share/applications/codex-desktop.desktop` and
     `~/.config/autostart/codex-desktop.desktop` launch through
     `/usr/bin/env ELECTRON_OZONE_PLATFORM_HINT=x11 ... --ozone-platform=x11`.

5. Verify installed app:
   - `readlink -f ~/.local/opt/codex-desktop/current`
   - Read installed `resources/app.asar` package metadata and confirm version/build.
   - Search installed `app.asar` for preserved Linux patch markers.
   - After relaunch, inspect the live process and confirm the Codex command line
     includes `--ozone-platform=x11`; this is required before judging pet drag
     or z-order behavior.

6. Release when requested:
   - Commit with a Conventional Commit, usually `chore: refresh linux port to <version>`.
   - Push `main`.
   - Create and push annotated tag `v<version>`.
   - Watch the Linux release workflow to success.
   - Verify release assets include:
     - `codex-app-linux-x64-v<version>.AppImage`
     - `codex-app-linux-x64-v<version>.deb`
     - `codex-app-linux-x64-v<version>.rpm`
     - `codex-app-linux-arm64-v<version>.deb`

## Notes

- The repo currently has no Arch-package release lane. Do not claim one shipped unless the workflow has been extended and verified.
- `Codex.dmg`, `desktop/tmp`, and `desktop/out` are generated inputs/outputs; do not commit them unless the repo policy changes.
- If GitHub says `release not found` immediately after tag push, watch the workflow. The release is created by the tag-driven workflow after artifacts publish.
